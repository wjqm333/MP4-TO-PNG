# MP4-TO-PNG
This is a simple python script that converts a video file to a series of PNG images. It uses the OpenCV library to read the video file and save the frames as PNG images.

## Usage
To use the script, simply run the following command:
```
python mp4_to_png.py <video_file> <output_dir> <frames_between_savedImages>
```
Where `<video_file>` is the path to the video file you want to convert, `<output_dir>` is the directory where you want to save the PNG images and `<frames_between_savedImages>` is the interval of saving frames.
